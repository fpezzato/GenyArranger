# GenyArranger

Sometimes you can have a lot of Genymotion (or, actually, Oracle VM players)running on your machine.
You can now automatically arrange them without manually resize them all.  

Supported OS so far:
* Mac :+1: 
* Linux :-1: _help wanted!_
* Windows :-1: _help wanted!_

## info on te Mac version:
This is my first (tiny) attempt to play with applescript, so every improvement/help is more than welcome!

---
How to use the Mac version:
* 1) Clone or copy the script locally (or the .app folder in this repo)
* 2) Run it.

Note:
if you get this error message:
![Possible error message](images/mac_permission_error.png?raw=true =100x "Possible error message" )
You have to add the permission under the 'Security'
![Security permission](images/mac_security_privacy.png?raw=true =100x "Security permission" )
